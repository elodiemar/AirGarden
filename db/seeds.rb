# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# require "faker"
# User.create(
#   first_name: "Elodie",
#   last_name: "Mariton",
#   email: "e.mariton@hotmail.fr",
#   password: "123456"
#  )
#  puts "user created"

# 10.times do
#     user = User.first
#     p garden = Garden.create(
#     title: Faker::Movie.title,
#     description: Faker::Movie.quote,
#     capacity: rand(0..10),
#     size: rand(0..1000),
#     price_per_hour: rand(0..20),
#     user_id: user.id
#   )
#    garden.save!
# end

# puts " created 10 fakes garden"
